    <p>My name is John Asuron and I'm from Kenya. I was born and raised in Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya. Growing up, I was always interested in technology and how it can be used to improve people's lives. This led me to pursue a degree in computer science from the University of Nairobi.</p>
    <p>After graduating, I worked for several years as a software engineer at a local technology company. During this time, I gained valuable experience in developing software solutions for various clients. However, I realized that I wanted to do more than just write code.</p>
    <p>So, I decided to start my own technology company that focuses on providing affordable and accessible technology solutions to small businesses in Kenya. We've been in business for a few years now and I'm proud of the work we've done so far.</p>
    <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy hiking in the beautiful Kenyan countryside and spending time with my family and friends.</p>
